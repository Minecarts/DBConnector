##DBConnector Plugin
This is just a small, quick dirty plugin that wraps the snaq DBPool utility to let us manage our own MySQL connection pool. 
Since most of our plugins will store information in MySQL, this provides a nice easy to use interface to the pool within Minecraft.

The Snaq DBPool driver can be found at:
